Top Array/String Problems for Senior QA
These problems cover essential concepts:

Two Sum / Three Sum Variants (Hashmap/Two Pointers): Finding pairs/triplets with a target sum tests hashmap efficiency or two-pointer sorting logic, vital for data validation.

Product of Array Except Self (Prefix/Suffix Products): Tests efficient array traversal without division, common in data transformation.

Container With Most Water (Two Pointers): Efficiently finding maximum area using shrinking boundaries.

Spiral Matrix (Matrix Traversal): Tests matrix boundary management and iteration logic.

Move Zeroes / Remove Duplicates (In-Place): Focus on modifying arrays in-place while preserving order (Two Pointers).

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window): Fundamental sliding window for substring problems.

Minimum Window Substring (Sliding Window/Hashmap): Complex sliding window for finding a minimal substring containing all chars from another string.

First Missing Positive (In-Place Hashing): Advanced in-place array manipulation for a tricky constraint.

Validate Parentheses / Reverse String/Palindrome: Essential stack/string manipulation basics.

Group Anagrams / Valid Anagram (Hashmap/Sorting): Grouping/comparing strings based on character counts.

Here are 10 key LeetCode Linked List problems, categorized by difficulty and importance for a Senior QA:
Core & Medium Difficulty (Must-Knows):

Reverse Linked List (Easy/Medium): Iterative & Recursive solutions, fundamental for understanding pointer manipulation.

Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy): Practice dummy nodes and iterative merging.

Linked List Cycle (Easy/Medium): Implement Floyd's Tortoise & Hare (Two-Pointer) algorithm.

Remove Nth Node From End of List (Medium): Excellent for two-pointer technique.

Palindrome Linked List (Easy/Medium): Tests recursion and fast/slow pointers for finding the middle. 

Advanced/Senior-Level (Showcasing Depth):

6. Add Two Numbers (Medium): Simulating addition, great for handling carry-overs.

7. Copy List with Random Pointer (Medium/Hard): Involves deep copying and hash maps/pointers.

8. Rotate List (Medium): Modifying list structure efficiently.

9. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (Medium): Advanced handling of duplicate nodes.

10. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List (Medium): Tests handling complex list structures (doubly/multilevel).
